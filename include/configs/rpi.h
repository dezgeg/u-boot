/*
 * Memory layout for where various images get loaded by boot scripts:
 *
 * I suspect address 0 is used as the SMP pen on the RPi2, so avoid this.
 *
 * fdt_addr_r simply shouldn't overlap anything else. However, the RPi's
 *   binary firmware loads a DT to address 0x100, so we choose this address to
 *   match it. This allows custom boot scripts to pass this DT on to Linux
 *   simply by not over-writing the data at this address. When using U-Boot,
 *   U-Boot (and scripts it executes) typicaly ignore the DT loaded by the FW
 *   and loads its own DT from disk (triggered by boot.scr or extlinux.conf).
 *
 * kernel_addr_r has different constraints on ARM and Aarch64.
 *   For Aarch64, the kernel image is uncompressed and must be loaded at
 *   text_offset bytes (specified in the header of the Image) into a
 *   2MB boundary. As Linux uses a default text_offset of 0x80000, load
 *   the kernel at 0x80000 so that the 'booti' command does not need
 *   to perform any relocation of the Image in the typical case.
 *
 *   For 32-bit ARM, it must be within the first 128M of RAM in order for the
 *   kernel's CONFIG_AUTO_ZRELADDR option to work. Since the kernel will
 *   decompress itself to 0x8000 after the start of RAM, kernel_addr_r
 *   should not overlap that area, or the kernel will have to copy itself
 *   somewhere else before decompression. Similarly, the address of any other
 *   data passed to the kernel shouldn't overlap the start of RAM. Pushing
 *   this up to 48M allows for a sizable kernel to be decompressed below the
 *   compressed load address.
 *
 * scriptaddr can be pretty much anywhere that doesn't conflict with something
 *   else. Choosing 64M allows for the compressed kernel to be up to 16M on
 *   32-bit ARM and roughly 64M for the uncompressed kernel on Aarch64.
 *
 * pxefile_addr_r can be pretty much anywhere that doesn't conflict with
 *   something else. Choosing 65M allows for any boot script to be up to 1M,
 *   which is hopefully plenty.
 *
 * ramdisk_addr_r simply shouldn't overlap anything else. Choosing 66M allows
 *   for any PXE configuration file to be up to 1M, which is hopefully plenty.
